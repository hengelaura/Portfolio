            <p>Upon graduating from St. Cloud State University with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering, I transitioned from intern to full-time employment at IBM. I spent just about seven years as a Hardware Development Engineer where I worked with tools including GitHub, Jira, and Trello. My teams used Agile Methodologies to plan and develop our hardware. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work on projects that allowed me to interface with stakeholders, define project plans and milestones, and present on technical project and bugs to a variety of audiences.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, I chose to separate from IBM in order to pursue a career in data engineering and data analysis. I am looking to leverage my knowledge in programming, data pipelines, data warehouses, data analysis, and presentations to create a lasting, positive impact on society and nature. As an initial step, I chose to pursue a Data Engineering Certificate from MIT xPRO to enable me to transform the world through the collection, transformation, and analysis of data. I've been working on personal projects, so be sure to check out my projects page and my GitHub!</p>
            <p>Curiosity and a hunger for learning have led me to explore various crafts and areas of study. I believe that a deeper understanding of a subject can be had by cultivating new perspectives through experiences that may not seem related on the surface. I particularly have a love for the fiber arts, and I continue to find new ways to learn by practicing knitting, crochet, sewing, yarn spinning, and weaving. I have found these tasks to be a great way to expand and train my mind to be able to solve problems with innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>I continue to dabble in woodworking by restoring furniture pieces and looms. I love to explore the natural world with my trusty pup, Kisby, leading the way. On quiet nights, I like to unwind by playing video and tabletop games both solo and as a team.</p>
